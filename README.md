Creating a House in Blender, and learning basic shortcuts


Im going to create a basic model of a house... then learn about shading/rendering

first thing i did was scale up to square objects then I found a shortcut to merge these 2 objects together...

I learn about selecting edges and faces going into edit mode... and how 1,2,3 corresponds to each of them. I learnt how to extrude as well
however id did get into a lot of problems which was quite time consuming to fix. I also learnt a shortcut to duplicate and making whatever i select
into a new object by going into the Mesh (Edit Mode) >> Seperate >> Selection

I went into the sculpt mode trying to learn how to sculpt characters and i made this.

started off with the U.V sphere and messed around with the tools

Then i started doing something about the materials/ color of the enemy

This is just base color and how u can do it... u can also import materials from the internet OR you can
make it in blender the import them


I also imported everything to unreal engine this project i made
